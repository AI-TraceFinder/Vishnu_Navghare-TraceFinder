# 🔍 TraceFinder – Forensic Scanner Identification
## Internship Project (8 Weeks)

### 📌 Project Overview
TraceFinder is a digital forensics project aimed at identifying the **scanner device (brand/model)** used to scan a document or image.  
Each scanner introduces unique artifacts such as sensor noise, texture patterns, and compression traces.  
These patterns are learned using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze scanner-specific noise and artifacts
- Extract forensic features from scanned images
- Train ML and CNN models for scanner identification
- Provide explainable AI insights for predictions
- Deploy a lightweight demo application

### 🗂 Project Structure
- `data/` – Raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/` – Week-wise experimentation
- `src/` – Modular source code
- `outputs/` – Models, plots, and reports
- `docs/` – Documentation and references

### 🧪 Tools & Technologies
Python, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, CNNs, Grad-CAM, SHAP, Streamlit
